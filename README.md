# ict
Intrig C++ Tools

*ict* ict is a small set of openly available reusable components developed and used by Intrig.  They are a result of
countless hours of programming, restarts, and refactoring.  In the end, we are left with an almost trivially simple set
of components that should prompt you to say, "That doesn't seem very hard."
